            <h4 class="pb-2 mb-2">Background</h4>
            <p> I am a college junior studying computer science. I took a UI/UX in order to learn about different
              aspects of CS than those covered in the classes I have taken thus far. During the first week of class,
              we looked at the portfolios of professional UI/UX designers. One that particularly stood out to me
              was that of Jesse Prague. Although she is now a product designer at Meta, many of the pieces on her
              website
              were those that she had designed while a college student and were projects specificaly geared towards
              fellow
              college students. Inspired by this, as I implemented various projects this semester, I decided to focus on
              designing things geared towards college students and investigating issues that my peers and I face
              regularly.
              <!-- Additionally, ever since I was little, I have loved to bake.
              Therefore, as I
              learned about the different aspects of UI/UX work, I decided to focus my projects on topics related to the
              different
              aspects of baking in college: buying ingredients, finding recipes, managing a budget and splitting costs
              with friends,
              and potentially selling baked goods to others. -->

              of these aspects of UI/UX design:

                    <h3>Personas and Storyboarding:</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">Because it is so conviently located relative to campus, CVS is a common
                      stopping place
                      for students buying snacks, daily necessities, cleaning supplies, etc. However, one issue with
                      shopping at CVS
                      is the self-checkout machines, which are often quite slow and finicky.
                      <!-- I often buy ingredients at CVS. It is reletively cheap,
                      thus helping me stay within budget. More importantly it is very conviently located and doesn't
                      require
                      prior planning to go to, allowing me and my friends to spontaneously decide to bake something when
                      we want to
                      without having to worry about not having a lot of time to buy ingredients. -->
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text"> Therefore, for the personas and storyboarding assignment where we were tasked
                      with
                      observing users interact with an interface and developing personas and a storyboard, I chose to
                      focus
                      on the CVS checkout machine, as it is an interface that my peers and I interact with regularly.
                      <!-- However, one issue with CVS is the checkout machine, which is often quite slow
                      and finicky. Therefore, this first project uses personas and storyboarding to investigate
                      experiences and
                      common issues that various users have while interacting with said machine. -->

                    <h4>Wireframing</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">After learning about personas and storyboarding, we moved onto prototyping,
                      starting with LoFi wireframing. I completed this project at the beginning of the semester when
                      there was an issue
                      with lines in dinig halls being too long during the meal time rush, thus making it difficult for
                      students to get
                      food during their breaks. This inspired my to design a wireframe for a potential app that students
                      could use to
                      check the wait times at various dining halls in order to find a location where they would have
                      time to get food between
                      classes.

                    <h4>Iterative Design:</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      Another issue commonly faced by my peers and I is splitting checks when we get food together.
                      Therefore,
                      for iterative design, my group my group decided to work on
                      a prototype of an app
                      for a startup called Orca, which is focused on providing one location where gen Z users can manage
                      their budgets, pay friends,
                      split checks, etc, because it seemed like something we would all actually use.

                    <h3>Development:</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      In our free time, many of my friends and I love to bake. However, between juggling classwork and
                      extraciriculars,
                      it is sometimes a struggle to find recipes that we actually have time to make. Additionally, many
                      of us have various
                      dietary restrictions/allergies (e.g. celiacs, lactose intolerance, etc).
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      Inspired by this, I developed a WebApp that takes recipes from one of our favorite baking blogs
                      and allow users
                      to sort the recipes by cooktime and filter them by different dietary restrictions.

        <h5>Overview and General Process</h5>
        <p> The goal of this project was to continue building off the skills developed in personas and storyboarding
          relating to identifying
          user groups and issues with interfaces and experiment Balsamiq to design a LoFi prototype that would
          potentially solve one of the issues
          identified for said user group.
          As mentioned above, for this project was inspired by the long lines of dining halls and how my peers and I
          often spent
          much of our lunch breaks either going from dining hall to dining hall to find one with short enough lines or
          just waiting in
          line.
        </p>
        <p> When designing this wireframe, I first created a series of sketches of potential designs, then talked
          through these designs
          with a partner, determining which aspects of each design to use in the final version in order to make the
          hypothetical app as
          easy to use and navigate as possible.

                        for the dining
                        hall as a whole. At the top of the app, there is a scale that goes from 0 to 40min, to give the
                        user a sense of
                        what "short," "medium," and "long" mean.</p>

          Iterative Design
        </h3>
        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p>Following LoFi prototyping, we moved onto using Figma to design HiFi prototypes. For this project, my group
          chose to design a mockup of an App for the startup Orca, which
          is focused on
          providing one location where gen Z users can manage
          their budgets, pay friends,
          split checks, etc.</p>
        <h5>Process</h5>
        <p>When designing the app, we first discussed a variety a different sketches, which culminated in the making of
          a LoFi wireframe. We then moved onto making our HiFi prototype in Figma. This prototype went
          through a few iterations where we incorpoated peer feedback. We also submitted the HiFi prototype to a user
          testing website to investigate how actual potential users would interact with it to complete a series of tasks
          we had designed.
        </p>
        <p>Below is our final HiFi prototype -- feel free to click buttons and interact with the App to get a sense of
          how
          it would work!

          <h5>Overview and General Process</h5>
          <p> Finally, I got to move beyond prototyping to designing an actual webApp. For this
            project I was inspired by how my friends and I choose recipes to bake to
            design a WebApp that allows users to sort and filter recipes based on cooktime and dietary restrictions.
          </p>
          <p> When developing this WebApp, I experimented with and learned about using separate components and state
            to
            allow users to trigger
            changes in the page. Specifically, users can click on the different radio buttons that determine how the
            data is
            filtered and
            ordered in order to change the state of the constants that determine these properties. Additionally,
            users can
            add/remove items
            to/from the "Favorites" list. When using state and components, I also learned about passing data through
            the
            different components
            via "props."
